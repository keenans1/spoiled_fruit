# Spoiled Fruit Overview
This app aims to making deciding on a movie to watch easier by showing users available movies in alphabetical order. Once a user clicks on a movie, they can find out more, such as the run time, rating and overview. If a user knows the title of a movie they want to find out more about, they can search that title in our serach bar and all the title's that contain the search input will appear and the user can click their desired movie from that page, return home or make another search.
